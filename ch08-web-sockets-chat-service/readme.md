### Brokering WebSocket messages
 - A `WebSocket` is a very lightweight, two-way channel between a web page and the server. `WebSockets`, on
   their own, don't dictate much about what travels over this thin pipe, but one thing is for certain--â€‹ each
   web page, when connected to a server, has a separate session

 - `Spring WebFlux` provides an API that lets us hook into this `WebSocket`-oriented session, whether to
   transmit or receive. But no `WebSocket` session is immediately linked to another `WebSocket` session. If
   we were using `Spring Framework 4's WebSocket API`, we would be leveraging its most sophisticated
   Messaging API. This API was born in Spring Integration, and is the same concept found in Spring
   Cloud Streams. Spring MVC comes with a built-in broker to help bridge messages between different
   sessions. In essence, a message that originates in one `WebSocket` session must be transmitted to the
   broker where it can then be forwarded to any other `WebSocket` session that might be interested
